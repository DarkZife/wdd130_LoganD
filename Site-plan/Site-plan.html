      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is going to basically describe me and my channel. I will use the home page to describe my channel what games I like to play, My pc setup, advertise the other pages, in the future maybe and social media page/ or just add that stuff to the home page. Now to answer the questions, Why will people come?
        They will come from the channel to get merchandise. What questions will my site answer? Just where to buy merchandise, what kind of pc setup I have, where to check out my other content, etc. What types of activites will visitors want to complete on my site?
        Basically its a place for them to come get merchandise like I said, it will also tell the future plans that I have, plus they will easily be able to get to my other content. There is a lot of information needed for the actions on my site, 1. setup links
        2. put on videos on one of the pages 3. need to organize the entire page to make it look presentable 4. to make a good looking store, like those side scolling kind maybe(idk yet) 5. etc(there is still more I need to know but this is for all what I don't know yet).
        The main reason why people will come to mine instead of any one elses, because it will be the only one, unless someone tries to make a copy, than its the original one, I don't think there will be any other site regarding to my streaming.

      <h3>DZ Merch</h3>
      <p>
        This page is going to be for all the merchandise I will be selling. What kind of merchandise? Store will be selling: Shirts, Hoodie, Jackets, Hats, stickers, Art, mug, Customized gear(aka mouse pads, laptop cases, etc.), my apps that i create promoted, etc.

      <h3>Platforms</h3>
      <p>
        This page is going to be really simple. I want to basically split it in two one side showing twitch stuff such as a link to my twitch, some images, recent video, and a spot to go donte, and etc. The other half will be for YouTube, and basically the same as twitch just YouTube links.
